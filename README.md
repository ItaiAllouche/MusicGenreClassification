## Background
As our final project in Deep learning course, we chose a problem of genre classification of a given 30-sec track.
  We chose to solve this problem using transformer architecture.

## The Model
We used the model facebook/wav2vec2-large-100k-voxpopuli, a Facebook's Wav2Vec2 large model pre-trained on the 100k unlabeled subset of VoxPopuli corpus.
      https://huggingface.co/facebook/wav2vec2-large-100k-voxpopuli

## Dataset
We used the femiliar <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification">GTZAN</a> dataset.
The dataset consists of 1000 audio tracks each 30 seconds long.
It contains 10 genres, each represented by 100 tracks:
The genrs are: blues, classical, country, disco, hiphop, jazz, metal, pop, reggae, rock.
The tracks are all 22050Hz Mono 16-bit audio files in .wav format.


## Agenda

|File       | Purpsoe |
|----------------|---------|
|`img`| Contains images for README.md file  |
|`train_30s_model.ipynb`| train the model on 30 sec-long tracks |
|`train_15s_model.ipynb`| train the model on 15 sec-long tracks  |
|`eval_model.ipynb`| evaluate the model.|


## 30_sec model
This model was trained on 30 sec long tracks.
performance:

87% accuracy on validation set

## 15_sec model
This model was trained on 15 sec long tracks.
Each 30-sec track was divided into 2 sub-track on 15 sec long
performance:

78.85% accuracy on validation set

## 10_sec model
This model was trained on 10 sec long tracks.
Each 30-sec track was divided into 3 sub-track on 10 sec long
performance:

### Running Locally

Press "Download ZIP" under the green button `Clone or download` or use `git` to clone the repository using the 
following command: `git clone https://github.com/taldatech/ee046211-deep-learning.git` (in cmd/PowerShell in Windows or in the Terminal in Linux/Mac)

Open the folder in Jupyter Notebook (it is recommended to use Anaconda). Installation instructions can be found in `Setting Up The Working Environment.pdf`.


## Installation Instructions

For the complete guide, with step-by-step images, please consult `Setting Up The Working Environment.pdf`

1. Get Anaconda with Python 3, follow the instructions according to your OS (Windows/Mac/Linux) at: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
2. Install the basic packages using the provided `environment.yml` file by running: `conda env create -f environment.yml` which will create a new conda environment named `deep_learn`. If you did this, you will only need to install PyTorch, see the table below.
3. Alternatively, you can create a new environment for the course and install packages from scratch:
In Windows open `Anaconda Prompt` from the start menu, in Mac/Linux open the terminal and run `conda create --name deep_learn`. Full guide at https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands
4. To activate the environment, open the terminal (or `Anaconda Prompt` in Windows) and run `conda activate deep_learn`
5. Install the required libraries according to the table below (to search for a specific library and the corresponding command you can also look at https://anaconda.org/)

### Libraries to Install
